Narrative Plan
Alison Hau (ahau)

The scene is from Finding Nemo (2003).  

Marlin and Dory are lost and need directions to Sydney (after they escape the jellyfish, if you've seen the movie).  Dory asks a dark and mysterious fish for directions, which makes Marlin nervous.  As Marlin begs her to reconsider, Dory shouts to the fish from far away, asking for directions to Sydney, but as the shadowy fish gets larger they realize it's actually a whale.  Dory, who is proficient at whale languages, translates their query into the majestic whale language.  Marlin scolds Dory for causing a fuss, and as Dory keeps trying her hand at a few whale dialects the whale disappears.  Marlin thinks it's for the best, because the whale might've been looking for food rather than feeling helpful, but Dory reassures him that whales don't eat clownfish, only krill.  Just as she finishes saying this, a swarm of krill rushes past the pair, warning them to swim away!  The huge baleen of a blue whale appear behind the fish right before the two are swallowed whole.
Inside the whale's mouth, Marlin throws his body at the whale's baleen in a desperate attempt to escape.  Dory, on the other hand, seems largely unfazed and is enjoying the swish of water around the whale's mouth.  Marlin is desperate to leave the whale and find his son, who thinks he failed to protect.  As Dory comforts Marlin, they hear rumbling from the back of the whale.  Despite Dory's best efforts to speak to the whale from inside its own mouth, it's quickly apparent from the falling water level that the whale is about to swallow them whole.  The whale's tongue sweeps fish toward its throat, and Marlin and Dory hold on to the whale's tongue for dear life.  Taking a leap of faith, Marlin lets go of the whale's tongue and together he and Dory tumble down the whale's tongue and emerge from the whale's blowhole, splashing down in the Sydney harbor.
