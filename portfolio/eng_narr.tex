Marlin and Dory are travelling to Sydney.  Dory asks a dark and mysterious fish for directions.  Marlin reprimands her while she shouts to the fish.  

The fish grows and they see that the fish is.... a whale!  Dory sings to the whale. 

"Give us directions!!!"

The whale disappears and Marlin is frightened.  Dory tells him that whales eat krill, not Marlins.

Suddenly, they see a lot of krill near them.

(...pause for suspense...)

The whale swallows them whole!  Marlin frantically attacks the whale's baleen.  Suddenly they see that the surface of the water of the whale's mouth is approaching...

The whale flaps its tongue.  They hold onto the tongue while Dory begs Marlin trust her and let go.  Marlin scolds Dory and sees a huge \textipa{ZEm} below him.

(...pause again for suspense...)

He lets go.

The whale swallows them quickly and blows them out into Sydney.
